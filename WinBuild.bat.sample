rem This files shows how to link KSI tool with static libksi and its
rem dependencies to produce KSI tool binary and its debug info.

rem specify the libksi location - folder that contains subdirectories for
rem library and include files. See WinBuild.txt for more details to see
rem how the dependencies must be located on disk.

set KSI_DIR=C:\Users\Test\LIBS\libksi

rem specify how the libksi was linked.

set KSI_LIB=lib
set RTL=MTd

rem in this example it is assumed that libksi is build using windows native
rem libraries CryptoAPI and WinINet. To be able to link KSI tool successfully
rem with libksi all dependencies of the libksi must be satisfied. To learn
rem more about libksi and it dependencies read WinBuild.txt

set LNK_CRYPTOAPI=yes
set LNK_WININET=yes


rem Rebuild the KSI tool.

nmake clean
nmake /S KSI_DIR=%KSI_DIR% RTL=%RTL% KSI_LIB=%KSI_LIB% LNK_CRYPTOAPI=%LNK_CRYPTOAPI% LNK_WININET=%LNK_WININET%
