Building with Microsoft Visual Studio
=====================================

	This document describes how to build KSI command-line tool ksitool using
	Microsoft Visual Studio tools and different libraries.
	
	
Prerequisites
=====================================

	To be able to build GT KSI API one must have the following software pieces:

		1) Microsoft Visual Studio 10 or Windows SDK 7.1 for building tools.
		2) Guardtime KSI API 3.1.0
		3) Cryptography provider (must have one)
			3.1) OpenSSL 0.9.8g (recommended).
			3.2) Windows native CryptoAPI.
		4) Network provider (must have one)
			4.1) Lib Curl 7.37.0 (recommended).
			4.2) Windows native WinINet.
			4.3) Windows native WinHTTP.
	
	Given versions are the same used in testing. It is strongly	recommended
	to use exactly the same versions. 
	
	When KSI API uses OpenSSl or Curl the location of libraries must be
	specified containing KSI API itself. See make file options CURL_DIR,
	OPENSSL_DIR and KSI_DIR.  The structure of the directories must be
	as follows: Windows native libraries are already installed with
	Windows.
	
	For CURL
	
    dll
    include
      |curl
    lib
	
	For OpenSSL
	
    dll
    include
      |openssl
    lib

	For KSI API

    dll
    include
      |ksi
    lib
	
	
	
	
Build process
=====================================
	
	Below is the abstract structure of the project that describes the location
	of the source code, make files and output. Root directory contains top-level
	build scripts that are used to build ksitool. After successful build obj and
	out directory is created. Obj directory contains compiled obj files. Out 
	directory contains executable.
	
	//Top level build scripts
    WinBuild.bat
    makefile
    
	//Source code for ksitool
	src
      | *.c
      | *.h
      
   //Folders and files generated during build
   obj
     |*.obj
   out
     |*.exe


Configuring build scripts
=====================================	
	
	For building process, above described top-level make file or WinBuild.bat
	must be called. WinBuild32 contain the call	to the make file.
	
	Make file can be executed via CMD shell or Visual Studio command prompt
	shell. When using CMD shell environment must be configured using setenv
	command. For example setenv /x64.
	
	Make file has following tasks:
	
		1)default	- build ksitool executable.
		2)clean 	- clean build.
	
		
	Make file has following options:
	
		1) KSI_LIB		- select KSI API library format (lib, dll).
						Default is lib. 	
		2) RTL			- select C run-time library (RTL) (MT, MTd, MD, MDd).
						Default is MT.
		3) CURL_DIR 	- Directory containing Curl library and include files.
		4) OPENSSL_DIR 	- Directory containing OpenSLL library and include files.
		5) KSI_DIR 		- Directory containing KSI API library and include files
		5) LDEXTRA 		- extra flags for linker.
		6) CCEXTRA 		- extra flags for compiler.
		
	When compiling one must know how the KSI API was linked - DLL and RTL must
	be configured accordingly. The location of KSI_API must be specified by 
	defining KSI_DIR. If KSI API uses Curl or OpenSSL CURL_DIR and OPENSSL_DIR
	must be specified.

	Examples
	
	KSI API is built as lib using MT RTL and windows native libraries:
		nmake RTL=MT DLL=lib KSI_DIR="C:\KSI"
	KSI API is built as lib using MTd RTL and OpenSLL
		nmake RTL=MTd DLL=lib KSI_DIR="C:\KSI" OPENSSL_DIR="C:\OPENSSL"
	KSI API is built as dll using MD RTL and windows native libraries:
	nmake RTL=MD DLL=dll KSI_DIR="C:\KSI" OPENSSL_DIR="C:\OPENSSL"
